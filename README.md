## Methodology 

## How to use Code 

1. Insert path to the CSV Files provided in the "Data" Folder
2. Run Code for Data Cleaning and definition of Functions

3. Calculate Implied Forward Rates for a fixed Period / Financing with an equivalent Term Bond 

```
#Avaliable Values: Duration: 1, 2,5,10 (Years), 1, 90 (Days) [Requires to set days = T]
data <- fixed_carry(duration, days = F)
```
Output can be generated by running the following functions 
1. Plot Implied Forward Rate and Spot Date at Delivery (at the time the Forward Conctract was entered into or at the Delivery Date)
2. Plot difference between Implied Forward Rate and Spot Date at Delivery or at Trade Entry

``` 
# caption = Plot caption 
# title = Plot Title 
# data = Data Set generated from function fixed_carry()
# date = "Delivery" or "Entry" 

plot_rates(caption, title, data, date)
plot_diff(caption, title, data, date)
```
